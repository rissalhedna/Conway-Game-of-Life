# Week 1: Python Basics & Grid Representation

**Goal:** Learn basic Python syntax, including variables, lists (specifically nested lists), loops (`for`), and printing to the console. Understand how to represent a 2D grid structure in Python.

**Task:**

1.  **Represent the Grid:** Create a Python list of lists (a nested list) to represent the Game of Life grid. For example, a 3x3 grid.
2.  **Represent Cell States:** Decide how you will represent 'dead' and 'alive' cells within your grid structure. Using characters like `' '` (space) for dead and `'*'` for alive is a common starting point.
3.  **Initialize the Grid:** Fill your grid structure with an initial pattern of dead and alive cells. You can hardcode a simple pattern for now.
4.  **Print the Grid:** Write code using nested `for` loops to iterate through your grid structure and print it to the terminal, so it looks like a grid.

**Example Output (for a 3x3 grid):**

Start with an empty file or one containing only comments outlining the steps above. Write the Python code to achieve the tasks described.
